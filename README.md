This is the git repository of the Autonomus Mobile Robots project, developed by Antonio Scardino , Niccol√≤ Piraino e Marco Nacca.
It implements the formulas and functionalities of the paper [Trajectory Generation for Minimum Closed-Loop State Sensitivity](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8460546).
The aim is to reduce parametric variation disturbances to a differential drive unicycle controlled via  Dynamic FeedBack Lineaization by calculating an optimal trajectory through the minimization of the state and controller sensitivities.
